## Requirements
You'll need the following to be able to run this
- `discord`

- `dotenv`

To install the libraries run:
```
pip3 install discord
```
Replace discord with requests and dotenv as well. You will require an API Key to use the Global Qur'an API.

## Usage
For the bot to return a verse in Arabic, you first use the command `!arabic`, where you then specify the surah number and the verse number, separated by a colon.

In order to return a verse in English, you use the command `!ayah`, where you then specify the surah number and the verse number, separated by a colon, the same as the previous command.
